# CameronSeid.com

A personal website to showcase my local computer business as well as a portfolio of my development work.

It is primarily designed using Materialize, and the build process currently exclusively utilizes Webpack. To build, install with `npm install` inside the `src/` directory, and then `npm run build` to generate the output at the root.

The live version of the page pulls from the master branch of this repository automatically.
